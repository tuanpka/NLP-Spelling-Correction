<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/oF4ydmr.png)  

Natural language processing (NLP) is a statistical procedure that uses orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. This transformation is defined in such a way that the first principal component has the largest possible variance, and each succeeding component in turn has the highest variance possible under the constraint that it is orthogonal to the preceding components.

NLP  is mostly used as a tool in exploratory data analysis and for making predictive models. It is often used to visualize genetic distance and relatedness between populations. PCA is also used in neuroscience, computer graphics, image compression, computer vision, spectroscopic data analysis, natural language processing, neuroinformatics, and cancer studies.

<!-- Key Features -->
## Key Features
* Reduce Dimension from multiple dimensions to 2-3 dimensions

* Data visualization and analyze.



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* Python 3.8 or newer
  ```sh
  [npm install npm@latest -g](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3121/)
  ```
* Google colab: Use this when you just need simple implement 

  ```sh
  https://colab.research.google.com/
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   
   [Click here to take a git clone ](https://github.com/tuanpka/NLP-Spelling-Correction.git)  

2. Install Python IDE
   ```sh
   https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download
   OR
   https://www.jetbrains.com/dataspell/download
   ```
3. Open .ipynb file with your IDE
4. Change the image location to your path


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Process

* Using Breast Cancer dataset from UCI ML Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)
* Perform principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensions (30 to 2)
* Making the data easier to visualize and analyze
